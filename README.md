# hotwire

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook used for a hands-on computer session in a Masters class on Turbulence in Fluids at ENS de Lyon.
The goal is to analyze longitudinal velocity measurements made with a hot wire in a wind tunnel at ENS de Lyon.
The experiment was conducted by Christophe Baudet and Antoine Naert.

The notebook contains the questions and some tips.

This notebook is adapted after a document written by Laurent Chevillard.

## How to use

Open a terminal and type the following commands:

```
git clone https://framagit.org/cherbert/hotwire
cd hotwire && make install
```

This will automatically download the data, setup a virtual environment and open the notebook in your browser.

## Prospects

In the future I may add data from Direct Numerical Simulations, in addition to the experimental data.
